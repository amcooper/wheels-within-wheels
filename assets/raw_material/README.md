# appname

This MEAN-stack application was built with [Wheels Within Wheels](https://github.com/amcooper/wheels-within-wheels), the CRUD app that makes CRUD apps.


## Up and running

* Download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org). This will also install the command line utility npm.
* Download, install, and configure [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community).
* Install Bower on the command line: `npm install -g bower`
* In your new application directory, `cd` into the `public` directory and run these two commands: `npm install` `bower install`. (AngularJS arrives with this bower command.)
* Next, `cd ..` to get back to the root of the application directory and run `npm install` here. (ExpressJS arrives with this npm command.)
* Run `node server.js`. 
* Open a browser and visit localhost:8080. Your MEAN-stack app will be running there!
